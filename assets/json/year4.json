Doing a detailed set of tests will help us identify if there?s an underlying cause that needs to be addressed.?\n\nTypes of Tests Involved:\n\nBlood tests: To check for infections (like TB, syphilis) or autoimmune markers (like HLA-B27, ANA).\n\nImaging: Chest X-ray or CT scan to look for signs of TB or sarcoidosis.\n\nMantoux or Quantiferon-TB test: To rule out tuberculosis.\n\nOcular investigations: OCT, fundus fluorescein angiography, or ultrasound B-scan if needed.\n\nSpecialist referrals: To rheumatologist, pulmonologist, or infectious disease expert depending on findings.\n\nPrognosis & Follow-up:\n\n?If we find a cause, treating that will help control the eye inflammation.

It is generally felt on one side of the abdomen or pelvis and may vary each month, depending on which ovary is releasing the egg during that cycle. In some cases, a small amount of vaginal bleeding or discharge may occur.","uniqueid":"db02b73ec5fc4085af8abf516fd0b8b4","cno":"0","rno":"2","original_premium":"0"}},{"id":"9973","tid":"969","years":"4year","part":"Nothing","question_type":"Short

In acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO ; also referred to as Ogilvie syndrome), the colon may become massively dilated; if it is not decompressed, the patient risks perforation, peritonitis, and
