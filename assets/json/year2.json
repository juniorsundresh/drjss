Respecting autonomy requires healthcare professionals to provide patients with sufficient information, ensure their understanding, and support their ability to make autonomous choices.\n\nb) Beneficence is the principle that guides healthcare providers to act in the best interests of their patients and promote their well-being. It entails a duty to do good and to maximize benefits while minimizing harm. Beneficence involves providing appropriate and effective treatments, interventions, and care to improve the patient's health outcomes. Healthcare professionals must consider the risks and benefits of different options and strive to act in ways that optimize the overall welfare of the patient. Beneficence is closely linked to the principles of nonmaleficence (do no harm) and requires balancing the potential benefits against any potential risks or adverse effects.","uniqueid":"LK4ZDDF3Y1KSVT9ZV333ABYCWSB7JF","cno":"0","rno":"1","original_premium":"0"}},{"id":"13184","tid":"275","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Short Notes","question_text":"What is informed consent?

tissue samples for microscopic examination by processing them through a series of chemical solutions. It ensures that the tissue is properly preserved, dehydrated, cleared, and infiltrated with a suitable embedding medium (usually paraffin wax) for sectioning.\n\nKey Steps in Tissue Processing:\nFixation: Tissue is fixed using formalin or another fixative to preserve its structure.\nDehydration: Water is removed from the tissue using increasing concentrations of alcohol.\nClearing: Alcohol is replaced with a clearing agent (like xylene) to make the tissue transparent.\nInfiltration: The tissue is infiltrated with molten paraffin wax, which will solidify to support the tissue during sectioning.\nComponents:\nRetort/Chamber: Where tissue samples are placed.\nReagent Containers: Hold the different processing solutions.\nHeater: Maintains the temperature of wax for infiltration.\nVacuum Pump: Helps in infiltration by removing air pockets in tissue.\nBenefits of an Automatic Tissue Processor:\nConsistency: Provides uniform processing of multiple samples.\nTime-Saving: Automates the entire procedure, reducing manual labor.\nSafety: Minimizes human exposure to toxic chemicals.\nImproved Quality: Ensures proper preparation of tissues for

Emotional Support:\nListen to her concerns: Allow her to share her fears and worries about the diagnosis. It's crucial to provide a safe space where she feels heard.\nAcknowledge her feelings: Let her know that it's completely normal to feel upset or anxious after such a diagnosis.\nReassurance: Emphasize that TB, including extrapulmonary TB, is highly treatable with proper medication and adherence to the treatment plan. Many people recover fully from TB, and she will too with the right care.\n2. Educating Her About TB:\nExplain the condition: Describe that extrapulmonary TB affects organs like the lymph nodes, bones, or kidneys, and is usually not spread to others, unlike pulmonary TB.\nClarify transmission: Stress that extrapulmonary TB is rarely contagious, which can help ease fears of spreading the disease to others.\nTreatment plan: Discuss that the treatment involves taking multiple antibiotics over a 6-12 month period. Stress the importance of following the prescribed medication regimen to prevent drug resistance and ensure complete recovery.\nSide effects: Mention that TB medications can have side effects, but these can be managed. Encourage her to report any discomfort so the doctor can adjust the treatment if needed.\n3. Addressing Practical Concerns:\nRegular check-ups: Explain the importance of regular follow-up visits to monitor her progress and adjust treatment if needed.\nLifestyle guidance: Encourage her to maintain a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and stay active within her limits, as this supports the immune system and speeds recovery.\nSupport system: Suggest leaning on family, friends, or support groups. Having emotional support can make the journey less overwhelming.\n4. Open Communication:\nEncourage her to ask questions and clarify any doubts about her condition, treatment, or what to expect. Reassure her that you or her healthcare team are available to provide guidance and answer concerns throughout the treatment process","uniqueid":"6INBWTA553MSSGG95CAFQT8AOZUX93","cno":"0","rno":"2","original_premium":"2"}}]},"Nutrition& Environment":{"id":"109","chapter_name":"Nutrition& Environment","original_part":"PART I","year":"2year","questions":[{"id":"4660","tid":"298","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Essay","question_text":"\" "references":{"bookname":"","bookname2":"","bookname3":"","pageno":"","pageno2":"","pageno3":""},"metadata":{"remarks":"","uniqueid":"2793870B7BA24BAD9444CB4ADAB94815","cno":"0","rno":"0","original_premium":"1"}},{"id":"4661","tid":"299","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Short Notes","question_text":"\" "references":{"bookname":"","bookname2":"","bookname3":"","pageno":"","pageno2":"","pageno3":""},"metadata":{"remarks":"","uniqueid":"6F53399BD3B2410099F6BC0684A05B03","cno":"0","rno":"0","original_premium":"1"}},{"id":"4662","tid":"300","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Short Answers","question_text":"\" "references":{"bookname":"","bookname2":"","bookname3":"","pageno":"","pageno2":"","pageno3":""},"metadata":{"remarks":"","uniqueid":"319B155FC0A54E8291168179956F7F3E","cno":"0","rno":"0","original_premium":"1"}},{"id":"4856","tid":"326","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Short Notes","question_text":"Radiation injury","references":{"bookname":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition (2021)","bookname2":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, South Asia Edition (2014) Vol-1 ","bookname3":"","pageno":"428","pageno2":"428","pageno3":""},"metadata":{"remarks":"","uniqueid":"202FB3E17F9A4CC189EB4CF708BDE765","cno":"428","rno":"1","original_premium":"2"}},{"id":"4857","tid":"326","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Short Notes","question_text":"Protein Energy Malnutrition(PEM) (2)","references":{"bookname":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition (2021)","bookname2":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, South Asia Edition (2014) Vol-1 ","bookname3":"","pageno":"434","pageno2":"433","pageno3":""},"metadata":{"remarks":"","uniqueid":"A806CF1DA41B4A40A02A117505F296CC","cno":"434","rno":"2","original_premium":"2"}},{"id":"4858","tid":"326","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Short Notes","question_text":"Kwashiorkor (2)","references":{"bookname":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition (2021)","bookname2":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, South Asia Edition (2014) Vol-1 ","bookname3":"","pageno":"434","pageno2":"433","pageno3":""},"metadata":{"remarks":"","uniqueid":"96AA08D4EFD748E1B6C7E56A2A7ABD80","cno":"434","rno":"2","original_premium":"2"}},{"id":"4859","tid":"326","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Short Notes","question_text":"Vitamin A deficiency (4)","references":{"bookname":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition (2021)","bookname2":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, South Asia Edition (2014) Vol-1 ","bookname3":"","pageno":"346","pageno2":"437","pageno3":""},"metadata":{"remarks":"","uniqueid":"3F850645EE424762BB82AF6DA4F6C673","cno":"346","rno":"4","original_premium":"2"}},{"id":"4860","tid":"326","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Short Notes","question_text":"Vit D deficiency (5)","references":{"bookname":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition (2021)","bookname2":"Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, South Asia Edition (2014) Vol-1 ","bookname3":"","pageno":"438","pageno2":"440","pageno3":""},"metadata":{"remarks":"","uniqueid":"087214E7CA89430091FBA5F9590DF4A2","cno":"438","rno":"5","original_premium":"2"}},{"id":"4861","tid":"326","years":"2year","part":"PART I","question_type":"Short Notes","question_text":" 3 years male child had frontal bossing, pigeon chest, bowing of legs.

score) was in the differential diagnosis of leukocytosis . The LAP score was usually low in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which helped distinguish CML from other myeloproliferative neoplasms with leukocytosis and inflammatory leukemoid reactions, both of which had a normal or increased LAP score. Additionally, it was noted that the LAP score was also low in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), although this was not used as a diagnostic test for PNH. In the laboratory, the LAP score is determined using a cytochemical stain on a peripheral blood film followed by a semiquantitative visual estimation of the degree of staining in neutrophils.

proteinuria indicates conditions like glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome.\nTubular Disorders: Specific proteins can suggest tubular damage.\nAssessment of Severity and Prognosis:\n\nMonitoring: Amount of protein helps assess kidney disease severity and treatment response.\nDistinguishing Protein Sources:\n\nType Identification: Tests differentiate between glomerular and tubular proteinuria.\nUrine Protein Electrophoresis: Identifies specific protein abnormalities (e.g., multiple myeloma).\nScreening for Systemic Diseases:\n\nDiabetes and Hypertension: Proteinuria can indicate early kidney damage in these conditions.\nAutoimmune Diseases: Conditions like lupus may show renal involvement detectable through protein testing.\nEvaluation of Post-Renal
